                            All sets are presented as examples, as such they sometimes reflect my opinion.
                            A Xelor and an Elio can both be played as range dpt, but they don't necessarily have the exact same needs, for instance a Xelor will like having range points, while the Elio does not need any.
                            The stuffs are generic, so adapt them to your needs and/or gameplay ! <br>
                            
                            <br>
                            At lv 20, all characters can equip the same build. It's a generic full elementary masteries build. As you are early in the game, it is not necessary to specialise in a specific mastery yet.
                            <br>
                            This has the added benefit of having a single build that you can easily put on any of your characters, which allows you to test classes easily ! Just create a new character and give it your stuff :)
                            <br>
                            Note that playing as "purely support" is not very useful here, just have fun and deal damage with every class >=)

                        Do note that this build is very weak, and is meant to be only <b>temporary</b> equiped until you can get something better. The suggested "medium" build (here below) will easily do 50% to 100% more damage.
                        <p>
                            <ul>
                                <li> The hat, breastplate, ring and cape are all <b> free </b>. You only need to do the beginning of the main story quest in the sewer until you obtain the <b>compass</b> </li>
                                Thsi compass enables you to interact with the "brume" tiles, hidden on the outside map.
                                Once you have the compass, go to the brume locations in Astrub to loot the hidden chests, each of which contains a free item.                           
                            </ul>

                                <li> The goball items are droppable in the <b>goball dungeon</b> (Tainela, top-right of the map) </li>
                                <li> The tofu ring is droppable in the <b> tofu dungeon</b>, or on the <b>mobs related to the tofu species</b>,in the Astrub fields (top of Astrub, as well as on the right)</li>
                                <li> The belt is droppable in the <b>Larvae dungeon</b> or on the <b>mobs related to the larvae species</b>. Both of them can be found in the Astrub sewers (the same place the main quest throws you in, if you remember when you've obtained the compass) </li>
                            </ul>

                        <p>
                            As for <span style="color:var(--mauve)">Relic</span> items, there is none available before lv 50, so we can ignore them for now. (yay, less expensive items to buy!)
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            As for <span style="color:var(--violet)">Epic</span> items
                            <ul>
                                <li>(ring) <span style="color:var(--violet)">Satisfaction ring </span> - Probably the best lowcost relic of the game. 1AP on a ring is just incredible at this level.<br>
                                    Generally speaking rings are the weakest kind of equipment and give the least amount of stats of your build. (compare the stats given by one of your rings with the stats given by your cape for instance), and that holds until much later in the game (lv 180+).
                                    So, having a ring that grants  1AP is extremely good. You will keep this ring either until lv 65 where you'll replace it with a <span style="color:var(--violet)">Bludring</span> or until lv 125 where you'll replace it with a <span style="color:var(--violet)">Bagus Shushu</span> </li>
                                <li>(boots) <span style="color:var(--violet)">Satisfaction boots</span> -Don't touch this. +1MP boots and a decent chunk of hp for its level. This item exists for tryharders to do dungeons at higher difficulty, just forget about it for now.</li>
                            </ul>
