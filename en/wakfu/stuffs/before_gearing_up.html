                        Basic items have a rarity system, wherein the rarity directly relates to the quantity of stats given by the item. Listed by increasing rarity they are :
                        <ul>
                            <li style="color:var(--green)"> Green (rare) </li>
                            <li style="color:var(--orange)"> Orange (mythic) </li>
                            <li style="color:var(--yellow)"> Yellow (legendary) </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            So, two items with the same name but with each a different rarity will have the same stats, but in varying quantities.
                            To help understand : 
                            If I have a ring "magic ring of doom" which gives so elem mastery, depending on its rarity, it'd give something like 
                            <ul>
                                <li style="color:var(--green)"> Green : 10 hp, 5 elem </li>
                                <li style="color:var(--orange)"> Orange : 12 hp, 7 elem </li>
                                <li style="color:var(--yellow)"> Yellow : 15 hp, 9 elem </li>
                            </ul>
                        <p>

                        There also exists two other specific rarities:
                        <ul>
                            <li style="color:var(--violet)"> Violet (called Pink aswell) (Epic)</li>
                            <li style="color:var(--mauve)"> Purple (Relique)</li>
                        </ul>
                        These two rarities have a specific behaviour : They generally are very powerful items for their level, but you can only wear one of each at any time. So one epic, and one relic.<br>
                        <br>
                        So a green item version is weaker than its orange version, which itself is weaker than its legendary version.
                        <br>
                        Yellow items tend to be best-in-slots, which often makes them very expensive compared to their orange counterparts, for example.
                        Note that often, the stats difference between an orange and a yellow item isn't that big, yet the orange version will be listed for a fraction of the price at the selling boards. Which leads to our next point.
                        <br><br>
                        Total stats of a build don't just come from the equipped item base stats. Easily half of the stats come from the enchantement system. Having 4 good runes on an item allows for a lot of additional stats to be added, which at lower levels can go as far as doubling the item stats.
                        Thus, a full enchanted green stuff with 3 or 4 good runes on each item will be better than just having "better" items if you're not able to get runes for them.

                        As you guessed, enchanting inexpensive orange items is quite cheap, while enchanting big expensive legendary items gets very expensive very quickly.
                        It makes no sense to get legendary items unless you can afford buygin several of each item AND getting them to 4 runes AND rolling for at least 3 good runes. <br>
                        Note that pretty much all dungeons can be done with orange stuffs, unless you aim for the higher difficulties (S5+).
                        <br><br>

                        Lastly, a short mention of the sublimation system. Sublimation are kind of magical parchments that can be applied on any item to give it a special effect. There can only be one sublimation applied to an item at a time.
                        Most sublimations are irrelevant for the beginning of the game (don't bother before lv 110) as they are mostly used for best-in-slots builds (and useful ones are generally speaking quite expensive). Until you have more experience in the game and its systems, you can safely ignore them.
                        <br>
                        Exceptions to this rule can be made for some lowcost generally good sublimations that are strong and cheap. Here are some of these sublimations that I consider to be worthwhile early on :
                        <ul>
                            <li>Vital Return</li>
                            <li>Flaming Return</li>
                            <li>Light weapons expert </li>
                        </ul>
                        <br>

                        If you wonder when to change you gear and swap it for higher level items; generally speaking in Wakfu we make item sets every two level ranges, mostly because the stats differencial isn't very big. 
                        And there's also some enchantement system reasons, but whatever.<br>
                        Reminder : these level ranges correspond to the modulation system ranges (the at-the-level system), which also correspond to the dungeons minimum entrance level.<br>

                        For example :<br>
                        We can use our lv 20 gear to do the <b> lv 20 to 35 </b> range AND <b> 35 to 50 </b>. Then at lv 50 we get a new stuff, which we use for the <b> 51 to 65 </b> AND <b> 66 to 80 </b>.
                        <br><br>
                        Many players only get a build for levels 20, 50 ,80 ,110 ,140 ,170, 200, and finally 230.
                        <br><br>
                        If you wish to make your own builds or adapt the suggested ones to better suit your own playstyle, I suggest watching the following videos first in order to better understand what you want to do : <br>
                        (videos are FR, use subtitles. I may make one in English in the future if enough people ask for it)
