# Which Linux should you choose ?

## What's a "distro"
A distro (or distribution) is an Operation system (OS), it's the "main program" of your computer, the very first one that gets launched when you turn your computer on. You are likely familiar with Windows or MacOS.
Linux is the same thing, except that instead of being made by a single entreprise, it is made by the very large community of open-source developpers.
Linux is open-source, which means that the code used to write it is public, and anyone can consult it, or copy it.

Because anyone can start with that, many entreprises and organisations have created "their" version of Linux. We call these different takes on Linux "distributions".

Some distributions are focused on general users, and are essentially doing the same as Windows or MacOS, while some other are specialised for very specific things, such as running servers.
Here we'll focused on Linux Distros for daily use on our desktops.

## The main "it just works" distros
While picking some distros as "the main ones" will inevitably make some people angry, here is what I personnally consider as good choices for a normal user who would like to switch to Linux.
These are "it just works" distros; you install it and everything should work, no additiontional work required (or very little, and it is guided through some wizzard).

### Ubuntu
Ubuntu is one of the major ones, and the company behind it is Cannonical. It itself is based on Debian.
It is a good and stable distribution, with a lot of support. Due to the fact it is so widely used, and made by an entreprise, you generally can just install it on any computer and it just works.
In terms of interface and usage, it is closer to the typical Linux way. Closer to how MacOs does things than what Windows does.

### Linux Mint
Linux Mint is a disto which itself is based on Ubuntu, but modified with the goal of making a distro that is easy to start with for new Linux users.
Since it's based on Ubuntu, you inherit all the support from Ubuntu, which is great as Ubuntu is one of the most likely distros to be supported by software vendors, so apps will "just work".
In terms of interface and usage, it is closer to what Windows does, with a bottom bar and a bottom left menu to select from.

### Fedora Workstation
Fedora is the linux distro backed by Red Hat, one of the most influencial IT enterprise in the world. Parts of it are often used by Red Hat to make their entreprise version *Red Hat Enterprise Linux*.
Having the backing and contributions of an expert entreprise that actually sells it as a product, it is a distribution that is extremely solid and stable.

Little trivia : this is the distribution that Linus Torvald (the creator of Linux) uses for his computers.

## The other distros
There are plenty of distros with unique goals; those are generally more technical and require to invest some time and have the willingness to learn how things work in order to actually use them properly. I would not advise someone who has never used Linux to use them. Nevertheless, for experienced people, those distros can have significant advantages. Either in terms of performances, or for specific activities (like development).

### Arch
Arch has probably the most active community out of all distros.
Installing Arch requires you to know (at least vaguely) what each component of your OS does, and which one you want among the options.
This approach is quite technical, but allows you to end up with a distro that is tailored to your wants (you pick everything yourself, it's not chosen for you by some company), and that can be smaller, with potentially less bloat and less resources usage (although there is already next to no bloat in the other Linux distros, to be fair). 

### Gentoo
You thought Arch seems needlessly complicated ? Well, how about you start compiling your own distro specifically for your own hardware ?
This means that the OS you run is highly optimised for your computer, being potentially faster and using the least resources possible. That is if you manage to do it.
If you don't have extensive experience with Linux (and some basic programming skills), stay away. If you want to learn (and have a lot of time) on the other hand, this is a great distro.

### NixOs
This is a distro where you pick and choose what you install (kind of like Arch), but different in that you do so by creating templates. Or in other words, configuration files.
This allow to have a highly reproduceable system. While this doesn't have that much use for everyday home users, it is nice for people eager to learn, and devops-at-home-wannabe's.

### Kali
Kali Linux is a cybersecurity testing- oriented distro. Aka a "Hacker" distro, to put it in maybe overly plain terms.
I would not recommend it for daily use, as it is not intended to be used that way. Generally speaking, even for professionals, I would likely recommend either running it in a VM, or dual-booting.
#### Kali "Standard"
The standard Kali linux, oriented towards Pentesting, towards red teaming.

#### Kali purple
The "defensive" cybersecurity oriented distro, oriented towards blue teaming.
