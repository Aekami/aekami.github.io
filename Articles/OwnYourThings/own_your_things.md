# Take control back, own you things !

## The source of all evil
The Cloud™ became very popular as a quick-n-dirty way to just launch an app.
Then came the services. Everywhere. Everything became services. You used to be able to pay once to get a program and you liked that ? Too bad ! Now you'll pay our subscription every month, and if you can't anymore, no more program for you !

What did you say ? We upped the prices because we added a random new functionnality that nobody asked for, which you don't use, and you're wondering whether you could just continue using the lower subscription as you did previously ? Too bad, you'll pay for the useless functionnality like a good boi :) !
What are you gonna do ? Go to a competitor ? They're doing the same and you know it. you also know that you've been using our product for years, and that you don't want to have to move everything and re-learn a similar products. And we know you won't do it. Just. Pay.


## Salvation
Most entreprises and projects don't need to host on the cloud. Unless you are working at a GAFAM-like enterprise, you do not need the cloud.
Even huge entreprises such as banks, which have to follow state issued imperatives (such as 99.999% upstime) manage without the cloud. In the case of banks, it also is a independance and sovereignty matter; it seems obvious but as a bank handling everyone's money, you cannot afford to be left at the mercy of some cloud provider.

And banks got it right.

Why would you make yourself at the mercy of entreprises who don't have your best interest at heart ? You know they'll try to take as much money as possible from you, so why would you set yourself up in that trap ?
Why would you pay endless subscriptions ?
Why would you put yourself at the mercy of the whims of some big corporation ? 
Why would you want not to have control over your infrastructure (and thus your own business) ?
Why would you want to add needless complexity ?

# One example
VMWare is THE leading virtualisation actor. There several other viable alternatives, but VMWare is the industry-leading and market-warping one.
It was used for example for OVH's VPS servers offering. 
But then VAMWares was bought by Broadcom. And Broadcom decided to up the prices of their newly acquired software by doubling it in some instances.
OVH couldn't "just swap" their virtualisation solution. They were stuck with the vendor lock-in. Changing everything would take years and a lot of people. Not to mention already-running VM's that would need to seamlessly be migrated to the new virtualisation solution, while keeping the same functionnalities.
No choice. So they paid.

You are OVH. You are at the mercy of a vendor doubling their prices. And just like them, you will pay.

# How to escape
There are two main axis when taking back your independance. Running a server has two obvious parts : a software one (the programs you run) and a hardware part (the computer/server the software runs on)?

## Own your software
It is obviously not realistic to create everything from scratch. Happily enough you don't have to.
You have essentially two routes you can follow.

Either :
- go for a pay-for project, which offers a non-subscription pay-once base, with optionnal support and upgrades (those can be subscriptions if you really want to)
- go for a OpenSource project, which there is paid support for. This is for example the case for Red Hat entreprise Linux (with Red Hat offering paid support), or Ubuntu (with Cannonical offering support)

You can of course also just use in-house development (which is the most flexible and answsers to your exact needs, but require you to maintain your solution over time), or completely open source software (but then you need to make sure the project keeps updated, although even if a project dies down, you don't lose access to you program, and you have time to find alternatives, contrary to subscription-based services)


## Own your hardware
This is generally the one people like the least. Owning your own hardware means that
1. You have to buy it upfront. Sure in the not-so-long run it will cost a lot less than renting equivalent specs on the cloud, but the money has to be spent all at once now.
2. You have to maintain your hardware. Maintenance does have costs, and does require knowledge.
3. You need to be aware of more things. You have the freedom to pick and choose how everything works, which also entails you need to have at least a rough idea of how everything works. Aka, have a infra and/or devops guy.
4. You are responsible of your own machines. You are the ones that need to make sure that if a machine goes down, another can pick up the work. You are the ones who need to setup backups.
